# Predicting the Residential property prices in Ireland

Housing prices in Ireland is a significant question for everyone who has endured the ups and downs of Ireland's housing system over the past few years, if not the past generation. Historical home prices indicate the value of a property's past appraisals as well as its appreciation. The objective of this study is to apply machine learning techniques to analyse numerous variables, including their effects on property value, and to use the resulting data to develop a predictive model for property pricing.

## Useful Resources

The data collection phase consists of retrieving the necessary data and saving it on a disc. In the data transformation stage, the datasets will be cleaned and converted, i.e. data manipulation. Then, the approaches or algorithms required to meet the project's objectives are chosen. Visualize the results of each of the three objectives.
